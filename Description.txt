Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. 
Several research projects aim to assist visually impaired individuals through smart technology solutions integrating artificial intelligence and image processing.
These solutions include smart canes equipped with obstacle detection and identification features, wireless communication for safety, and virtual eyes using camera modules to recognize objects and provide voice assistance.
One such project, named Third Eye, utilizes the YOLOv5 image detection model to identify objects in the environment and employs text-to-speech converters like gTTS and pyttsx3 for generating descriptions of detected objects. 
This approach offers improved accuracy and usability compared to existing methods. Overall, these innovations seek to enhance the independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals globally.
